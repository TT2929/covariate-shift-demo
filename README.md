# covariate-shift-demo
This project presents an interactive web demonstration of the covariate shift problem in machine learning and how it can be mitigated using weighted Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Users can manipulate the test data distribution in real-time and visually observe the impact of KDE or KMM-based weighting on the model's decision boundary.


## Setup
Programs are implemented in Python.
The following packages can be installed via `pip` or `conda`:

- `numpy`
- `streamlit`
- `matplotlib`
- `math`
- `scikit-learn`
- `logging`


## Usage
Run the following.
- `streamlit run main.py`
